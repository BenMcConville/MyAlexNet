# MyAlexNet

Based on the 2012 ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (AlexNet) paper, is an implementation in Pytorch trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. In addition, to the original paper is an architecture implementing Batch Normalisation instead of Inter-Channel Local Response Normalisation (LRN) in all convolution layers in contrast to the original paper which implemented LNR in the 1st and 2nd layer.
