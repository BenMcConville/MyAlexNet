# MyAlexNet

Based on the 2012 ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (AlexNet) paper, is an implemention in Pytorch trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. In addition, to the original paper is an architecture implementing Batch Normalization instade of Inter-Channel Local Response Normalization (LRN) in all convolution layers incontrast to the original paper which implemented LNR in the 1st and 2nd layer.
